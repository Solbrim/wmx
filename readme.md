windows mixer with 2 commands

1. wmx mute <exe path contains... e.g. firefox> <time period> -- mutes the programs where the exe path contain the givne strong for n seconds
2. wmx eq  -- equalizies all program values to the current device volume

wmx --h -- use it, clap is 330kb of the exe size to provide a help framework. 


either way -- copy it

this hits the window api, gets the defautl output device, and runs 2 command against it (mute for a period of time, and equalize all audio sessions of a given device to 100% of the device volume)
